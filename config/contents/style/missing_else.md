Checks for `if` expressions that do not have an `else` branch.

NOTE: Pattern matching is allowed to have no `else` branch because unlike `if` and `case`,
it raises `NoMatchingPatternError` if the pattern doesn't match and without having `else`.

Supported styles are: if, case, both.

### Example: EnforcedStyle: if
    # warn when an `if` expression is missing an `else` branch.

    # bad
    if condition
      statement
    end

    # good
    if condition
      statement
    else
      # the content of `else` branch will be determined by Style/EmptyElse
    end

    # good
    case var
    when condition
      statement
    end

    # good
    case var
    when condition
      statement
    else
      # the content of `else` branch will be determined by Style/EmptyElse
    end

### Example: EnforcedStyle: case
    # warn when a `case` expression is missing an `else` branch.

    # bad
    case var
    when condition
      statement
    end

    # good
    case var
    when condition
      statement
    else
      # the content of `else` branch will be determined by Style/EmptyElse
    end

    # good
    if condition
      statement
    end

    # good
    if condition
      statement
    else
      # the content of `else` branch will be determined by Style/EmptyElse
    end

### Example: EnforcedStyle: both (default)
    # warn when an `if` or `case` expression is missing an `else` branch.

    # bad
    if condition
      statement
    end

    # bad
    case var
    when condition
      statement
    end

    # good
    if condition
      statement
    else
      # the content of `else` branch will be determined by Style/EmptyElse
    end

    # good
    case var
    when condition
      statement
    else
      # the content of `else` branch will be determined by Style/EmptyElse
    end
