Checks for usages of `each` with `<<`, `push`, or `append` which
can be replaced by `map`.

If `PreferredMethods` is configured for `map` in `Style/CollectionMethods`,
this cop uses the specified method for replacement.

NOTE: The return value of `Enumerable#each` is `self`, whereas the
return value of `Enumerable#map` is an `Array`. They are not autocorrected
when a return value could be used because these types differ.

NOTE: It only detects when the mapping destination is either:
* a local variable initialized as an empty array and referred to only by the
pushing operation;
* or, if it is the single block argument to a `[].tap` block.
This is because, if not, it's challenging to statically guarantee that the
mapping destination variable remains an empty array:

```ruby
ret = []
src.each { |e| ret << e * 2 } # `<<` method may mutate `ret`

dest = []
src.each { |e| dest << transform(e, dest) } # `transform` method may mutate `dest`
```

### Safety:

This cop is unsafe because not all objects that have an `each`
method also have a `map` method (e.g. `ENV`). Additionally, for calls
with a block, not all objects that have a `map` method return an array
(e.g. `Enumerator::Lazy`).

### Example:
    # bad
    dest = []
    src.each { |e| dest << e * 2 }
    dest

    # good
    dest = src.map { |e| e * 2 }

    # bad
    [].tap do |dest|
      src.each { |e| dest << e * 2 }
    end

    # good
    dest = src.map { |e| e * 2 }

    # good - contains another operation
    dest = []
    src.each { |e| dest << e * 2; puts e }
    dest
