Checks for usages of `unless` which can be replaced by `if` with inverted condition.
Code without `unless` is easier to read, but that is subjective, so this cop
is disabled by default.

Methods that can be inverted should be defined in `InverseMethods`. Note that
the relationship of inverse methods needs to be defined in both directions.
For example,
    InverseMethods:
      :!=: :==
      :even?: :odd?
      :odd?: :even?

 will suggest both `even?` and `odd?` to be inverted, but only `!=` (and not `==`).

### Safety:

This cop is unsafe because it cannot be guaranteed that the method
and its inverse method are both defined on receiver, and also are
actually inverse of each other.

### Example:
    # bad (simple condition)
    foo unless !bar
    foo unless x != y
    foo unless x >= 10
    foo unless x.even?

    # good
    foo if bar
    foo if x == y
    foo if x < 10
    foo if x.odd?

    # bad (complex condition)
    foo unless x != y || x.even?

    # good
    foo if x == y && x.odd?

    # good (if)
    foo if !condition
