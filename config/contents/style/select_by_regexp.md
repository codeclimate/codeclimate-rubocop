Looks for places where a subset of an Enumerable (array,
range, set, etc.; see note below) is calculated based on a `Regexp`
match, and suggests `grep` or `grep_v` instead.

NOTE: Hashes do not behave as you may expect with `grep`, which
means that `hash.grep` is not equivalent to `hash.select`. Although
RuboCop is limited by static analysis, this cop attempts to avoid
registering an offense when the receiver is a hash (hash literal,
`Hash.new`, `Hash#[]`, or `to_h`/`to_hash`).

NOTE: `grep` and `grep_v` were optimized when used without a block
in Ruby 3.0, but may be slower in previous versions.
See https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17030

### Safety:

Autocorrection is marked as unsafe because `MatchData` will
not be created by `grep`, but may have previously been relied
upon after the `match?` or `=~` call.

Additionally, the cop cannot guarantee that the receiver of
`select` or `reject` is actually an array by static analysis,
so the correction may not be actually equivalent.

### Example:
    # bad (select, filter, or find_all)
    array.select { |x| x.match? /regexp/ }
    array.select { |x| /regexp/.match?(x) }
    array.select { |x| x =~ /regexp/ }
    array.select { |x| /regexp/ =~ x }

    # bad (reject)
    array.reject { |x| x.match? /regexp/ }
    array.reject { |x| /regexp/.match?(x) }
    array.reject { |x| x =~ /regexp/ }
    array.reject { |x| /regexp/ =~ x }

    # good
    array.grep(regexp)
    array.grep_v(regexp)
