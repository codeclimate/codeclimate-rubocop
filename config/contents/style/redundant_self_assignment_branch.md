This cop checks for places where conditional branch makes redundant self-assignment.

It only detects local variable because it may replace state of instance variable,
class variable, and global variable that have state across methods with `nil`.

### Example:

    # bad
    foo = condition ? bar : foo

    # good
    foo = bar if condition

    # bad
    foo = condition ? foo : bar

    # good
    foo = bar unless condition
