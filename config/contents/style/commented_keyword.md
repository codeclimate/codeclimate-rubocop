Checks for comments put on the same line as some keywords.
These keywords are: `class`, `module`, `def`, `begin`, `end`.

Note that some comments
(`:nodoc:`, `:yields:`, `rubocop:disable` and `rubocop:todo`),
RBS::Inline annotation, and Steep annotation (`steep:ignore`) are allowed.

Autocorrection removes comments from `end` keyword and keeps comments
for `class`, `module`, `def` and `begin` above the keyword.

### Safety:

Autocorrection is unsafe because it may remove a comment that is
meaningful.

### Example:
    # bad
    if condition
      statement
    end # end if

    # bad
    class X # comment
      statement
    end

    # bad
    def x; end # comment

    # good
    if condition
      statement
    end

    # good
    class X # :nodoc:
      y
    end
