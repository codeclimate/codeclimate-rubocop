Check for uses of `Object#freeze` on immutable objects.

NOTE: `Regexp` and `Range` literals are frozen objects since Ruby 3.0.

NOTE: From Ruby 3.0, this cop allows explicit freezing of interpolated
string literals when `# frozen-string-literal: true` is used.

### Example:
    # bad
    CONST = 1.freeze

    # good
    CONST = 1
