Checks for the presence of superfluous `.rb` extension in
the filename provided to `require` and `require_relative`.

NOTE: If the extension is omitted, Ruby tries adding '.rb', '.so',
        and so on to the name until found. If the file named cannot be found,
        a `LoadError` will be raised.
        There is an edge case where `foo.so` file is loaded instead of a `LoadError`
        if `foo.so` file exists when `require 'foo.rb'` will be changed to `require 'foo'`,
        but that seems harmless.

### Example:
    # bad
    require 'foo.rb'
    require_relative '../foo.rb'

    # good
    require 'foo'
    require 'foo.so'
    require_relative '../foo'
    require_relative '../foo.so'
