This cop checks for grouping of mixins in `class` and `module` bodies.
By default it enforces mixins to be placed in separate declarations,
but it can be configured to enforce grouping them in one declaration.

### Example:

    EnforcedStyle: separated (default)

    # bad
    class Foo
      include Bar, Qox
    end

    # good
    class Foo
      include Qox
      include Bar
    end

    EnforcedStyle: grouped

    # bad
    class Foo
      extend Bar
      extend Qox
    end

    # good
    class Foo
      extend Qox, Bar
    end
