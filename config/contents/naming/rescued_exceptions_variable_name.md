This cop makes sure that rescued exceptions variables are named as
expected.

The `PreferredName` config option takes a `String`. It represents
the required name of the variable. Its default is `e`.

NOTE: This cop does not consider nested rescues because it cannot
guarantee that the variable from the outer rescue is not used within
the inner rescue (in which case, changing the inner variable would
shadow the outer variable).

### Example: PreferredName: e (default)
    # bad
    begin
      # do something
    rescue MyException => exception
      # do something
    end

    # good
    begin
      # do something
    rescue MyException => e
      # do something
    end

    # good
    begin
      # do something
    rescue MyException => _e
      # do something
    end

### Example: PreferredName: exception
    # bad
    begin
      # do something
    rescue MyException => e
      # do something
    end

    # good
    begin
      # do something
    rescue MyException => exception
      # do something
    end

    # good
    begin
      # do something
    rescue MyException => _exception
      # do something
    end
