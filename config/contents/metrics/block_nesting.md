This cop checks for excessive nesting of conditional and looping
constructs.

You can configure if blocks are considered using the `CountBlocks`
option. When set to `false` (the default) blocks are not counted
towards the nesting level. Set to `true` to count blocks as well.

The maximum level of nesting allowed is configurable.
