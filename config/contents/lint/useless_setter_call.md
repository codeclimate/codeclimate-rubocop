This cop checks for setter call to local variable as the final
expression of a function definition.
Its auto-correction is marked as unsafe because return value will be changed.

NOTE: There are edge cases in which the local variable references a
value that is also accessible outside the local scope. This is not
detected by the cop, and it can yield a false positive.

### Example:

    # bad

    def something
      x = Something.new
      x.attr = 5
    end

### Example:

    # good

    def something
      x = Something.new
      x.attr = 5
      x
    end
