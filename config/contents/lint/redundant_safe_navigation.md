Checks for redundant safe navigation calls.
Use cases where a constant, named in camel case for classes and modules is `nil` are rare,
and an offense is not detected when the receiver is a constant. The detection also applies
to `self`, and to literal receivers, except for `nil`.

For all receivers, the `instance_of?`, `kind_of?`, `is_a?`, `eql?`, `respond_to?`,
and `equal?` methods are checked by default.
These are customizable with `AllowedMethods` option.

The `AllowedMethods` option specifies nil-safe methods,
in other words, it is a method that is allowed to skip safe navigation.
Note that the `AllowedMethod` option is not an option that specifies methods
for which to suppress (allow) this cop's check.

In the example below, the safe navigation operator (`&.`) is unnecessary
because `NilClass` has methods like `respond_to?` and `is_a?`.

### Safety:

This cop is unsafe, because autocorrection can change the return type of
the expression. An offending expression that previously could return `nil`
will be autocorrected to never return `nil`.

### Example:
    # bad
    CamelCaseConst&.do_something

    # good
    CamelCaseConst.do_something

    # bad
    do_something if attrs&.respond_to?(:[])

    # good
    do_something if attrs.respond_to?(:[])

    # bad
    while node&.is_a?(BeginNode)
      node = node.parent
    end

    # good
    while node.is_a?(BeginNode)
      node = node.parent
    end

    # good - without `&.` this will always return `true`
    foo&.respond_to?(:to_a)

    # bad - for `nil`s conversion methods return default values for the type
    foo&.to_h || {}
    foo&.to_h { |k, v| [k, v] } || {}
    foo&.to_a || []
    foo&.to_i || 0
    foo&.to_f || 0.0
    foo&.to_s || ''

    # good
    foo.to_h
    foo.to_h { |k, v| [k, v] }
    foo.to_a
    foo.to_i
    foo.to_f
    foo.to_s

    # bad
    self&.foo

    # good
    self.foo

### Example: AllowedMethods: [nil_safe_method]
    # bad
    do_something if attrs&.nil_safe_method(:[])

    # good
    do_something if attrs.nil_safe_method(:[])
    do_something if attrs&.not_nil_safe_method(:[])
