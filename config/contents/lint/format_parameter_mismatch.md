This lint sees if there is a mismatch between the number of
expected fields for format/sprintf/#% and what is actually
passed as arguments.

In addition, it checks whether different formats are used in the same
format string. Do not mix numbered, unnumbered, and named formats in
the same format string.

### Example:

    # bad
    format('A value: %s and another: %i', a_value)

    # good
    format('A value: %s and another: %i', a_value, another)

    # bad
    format('Unnumbered format: %s and numbered: %2$s', a_value, another)

    # good
    format('Numbered format: %1$s and numbered %2$s', a_value, another)
