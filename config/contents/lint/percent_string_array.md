Checks for quotes and commas in %w, e.g. `%w('foo', "bar")`

It is more likely that the additional characters are unintended (for
example, mistranslating an array of literals to percent string notation)
rather than meant to be part of the resulting strings.

### Safety:

The cop is unsafe because the correction changes the values in the array
and that might have been done purposely.

```ruby
%w('foo', "bar") #=> ["'foo',", '"bar"']
%w(foo bar)      #=> ['foo', 'bar']
```

### Example:

    # bad
    %w('foo', "bar")

    # good
    %w(foo bar)
