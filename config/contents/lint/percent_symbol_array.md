This cop checks for colons and commas in %i, e.g. `%i(:foo, :bar)`

It is more likely that the additional characters are unintended (for
example, mistranslating an array of literals to percent string notation)
rather than meant to be part of the resulting symbols.

### Example:

    # bad

    %i(:foo, :bar)

### Example:

    # good

    %i(foo bar)
