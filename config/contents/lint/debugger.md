This cop checks for debug calls (such as `debugger` or `binding.pry`) that should
not be kept for production code.

The cop can be configured using `DebuggerMethods`. By default, a number of gems
debug entrypoints are configured (`Kernel`, `Byebug`, `Capybara`, `Pry`, `Rails`,
and `WebConsole`). Additional methods can be added.

Specific default groups can be disabled if necessary:
