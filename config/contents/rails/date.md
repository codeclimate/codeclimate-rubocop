This cop checks for the correct use of Date methods,
such as Date.today, Date.current etc.

Using Date.today is dangerous, because it doesn't know anything about
Rails time zone. You must use Time.zone.today instead.

The cop also reports warnings when you are using 'to_time' method,
because it doesn't know about Rails time zone either.

Two styles are supported for this cop. When EnforcedStyle is 'strict'
then the Date methods (today, current, yesterday, tomorrow)
are prohibited and the usage of both 'to_time'
and 'to_time_in_current_zone' is reported as warning.

When EnforcedStyle is 'flexible' then only 'Date.today' is prohibited
and only 'to_time' is reported as warning.

### Example:
    # no offense
    Time.zone.today
    Time.zone.today - 1.day

    # acceptable
    Date.current
    Date.yesterday

    # always reports offense
    Date.today
    date.to_time

    # reports offense only when style is 'strict'
    date.to_time_in_current_zone
